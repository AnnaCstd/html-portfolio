<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Me Before You</h3>
<p>It's a movie about cheerful girl named Louisa who landed a job as a caregiver of a wealthy young barker left paralyzed from a road accident. Louisa will try to show Will that life is worth living. This is one of my favorite movies because it shows how life can be so beautiful and hard at the same time.</p>

<h3>Rush Hour</h3>
<p>An action comedy movie about a Hong Kong detective who was hired to saved the daughter of a Chinese diplomat in Los Angeles. I love this movie because of Jackie Chan. It's one of my comfort movies.</p>

<h3>World War Z</h3>
<p>It's a zombie movie! I just love zombie movies. For all the zombie movies that I watched, this movie showed how humans find a solution to the apocalypse. The zombies here were scary they can climb and run fast. Yikes!.</p>
